# Programming Challenge

These programming challenges are used as a portion of the interview process.

**Note:** This challenge has been forked from the good folks over at Qlik!

**Note:** There are no trick questions, however there are some ways to go above and beyond the strict requirements of the question that can speak to the creativity of the candidate.

## How to Participate

Fork this repository and read the instruction text files in each challenge folder. Complete the challenges, commit and push back to your repository, then open a pull request against this project. We will close the pull request, but it notifies our dev team that someone has taken up the challenge!

## Rules

1. Submissions can be submitted in any language
2. Modify this readme to include a section
on how we can run your code.  This can either be an executable, docker image, a list of instructions, etc... We just need a way to be able to run your code on our computers!
3. 3rd-party vendor libaries can be used if needed


## Good luck!


## Code Execution

The code for all three tasks are written in javascript and hence it can be run individually in terminal by using NodeJS runtime. If NodeJS runtime is installed then it can be run by going to the file location in the terminal and type "node FileName.js". Incase of no NodeJS runtime, then it can be downloaded at "https://nodejs.org/en/download/".

For the third task, determining anagram, user input is required and hence "prompt-sync" module is used. To download "prompt-sync" follow the instructions below:
1. Go to the folder location where the anagram code is located.
2. Type "npm install" to install the dependencies.
4. Run the code by typing "node anagram.js" and it will prompt user to enter two strings.
