# Programming Challenge


Hi there,

So, Thomas asked me to accept this challenge and I decided to make it a little bit different, using Xamarin with UWP.
The result is very simple to test, since it's just one executable file to run in Windows for the 3 challenges.
And if you have VS 2019 with Xamarin, you can create both apps (iOS and Android) too!

# To run the app, go to:
Release - \Sorting\Sorting\bin\x86\Release\Sorting.exe
Debug -   \Sorting\Sorting\bin\x86\Debug\Sorting.exe

OR run inside Visual Studio 2019, opening the Solution file in: \Sorting\Sorting.sln


Hope you like it!

Best,
Luis Souza
